# IFC Map
This is a map for the Inland from the Coast website. It is made using MapboxGL-JS,
and a custom basemap style made in Mapbox Studio. The map is published via Github
pages at [https://css-lsu.github.io/ifc-map](https://css-lsu.github.io/ifc-map).

### Community Views
The map embed can be configured to directly zoom in to and display one of the
communities (Ascension Parish, Baker, Denham Springs, or the Plank Corridor).
This is illustrated at [https://css-lsu.github.io/ifc-map/embed-preview.html]
(https://css-lsu.github.io/ifc-map/embed-preview.html).

### Text Driven by Google Sheets
All of the non-basemap text on the map is powered by [a Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wBNtw2eDsF3x-Ap5CE2b3CLdtHHjH4u0q24oC-g2-Bw/edit#gid=1058899836).
Updates to the sheet are immediately reflected in the map.
